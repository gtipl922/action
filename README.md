A powerful GitHub Action that leverages the Google Gemini API to automatically generate comprehensive, professional, and context-aware `README.md` files for your repositories. Streamline your documentation efforts and ensure every project has a pristine introduction without lifting a finger.

## ‚ú® Features

This action is designed to be a developer's best friend for documentation:

*   **üß† AI-Powered Content Generation**: Utilizes the advanced capabilities of the Google Gemini API to understand your project and generate highly relevant and well-structured README content.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Seamless GitHub Action Integration**: Runs effortlessly within your GitHub workflows, making README generation an automated part of your CI/CD pipeline. Trigger it on pushes, pull requests, or manually via `workflow_dispatch`.
*   **üöÄ Boosts Developer Productivity**: Eliminates the time-consuming and often tedious task of writing READMEs manually, allowing your team to focus on core development.
*   **üêç Python-Based & Extendable**: Built with Python, ensuring readability, maintainability, and easy customization for specific project needs.
*   **üìù Professional Markdown Output**: Generates clean, well-formatted Markdown that adheres to best practices for GitHub READMEs, including sections for features, installation, usage, and more.
*   **üîß Customizable Inputs**: Configure the AI's prompt, target file path, and other parameters directly within your workflow file to guide the generation process.

## üíª Technologies Used

*   **Python**: The core language for the utility logic.
*   **Google Gemini API**: Powers the AI content generation.
*   **GitHub Actions**: The execution environment and integration platform.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

To use the Gemini AI README Generator, you'll primarily interact with it as a GitHub Action in your repository's workflow.

### Prerequisites

1.  **A GitHub Repository**: The repository where you want to generate the README.
2.  **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain a key from the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).
    *   Once you have the key, add it to your GitHub repository's secrets. Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` > `New repository secret`. Name it `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### Setting up the GitHub Workflow

1.  **Create a Workflow File**: In your repository, create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/generate-readme.yml`):

    ```bash
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    touch .github/workflows/generate-readme.yml
    ```

2.  **Add Workflow Content**: Copy the following YAML content into `.github/workflows/generate-readme.yml`. This example will run the action on every push to `main` and allows manual triggering.

    ```yaml
    name: Generate README with Gemini AI

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main # Or 'master', depending on your default branch
      workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual trigger from the GitHub Actions tab

    jobs:
      generate-readme:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: '3.x' # Specify your preferred Python version

          - name: Install Action Dependencies
            run: |
              python -m pip install --upgrade pip
              pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming your action has a requirements.txt

          - name: Run Gemini AI README Generator
            # Replace 'your-org/your-repo@v1' with the actual path to your action
            # If the action is within the same repository, you might use './' or a specific path.
            # Example for an action within the same repo at '.github/actions/gemini-readme-action/':
            # uses: ./.github/actions/gemini-readme-action/ # If action is a local path
            # For a published action:
            uses: your-org/your-repo@v1 # Example: 'gemini-org/gemini-readme-action@v1'
            with:
              gemini_api_key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
              # Optional: Provide additional context or override default behavior
              project_description: "A Python utility that automates README.md generation for GitHub repos using the Gemini API."
              output_file: "README.md"
              # Other potential inputs:
              # template_path: "./.github/README_template.md" # Path to a custom template
              # exclude_files: "tests/,docs/" # Comma-separated list of paths to ignore
    ```

### Workflow Inputs

*   `gemini_api_key` (Required): Your Google Gemini API key, stored as a GitHub secret.
*   `project_description` (Optional): A brief, explicit description of your project. This helps guide the AI more accurately. If not provided, the action will attempt to infer it from the repository.
*   `output_file` (Optional): The path where the generated `README.md` should be saved. Defaults to `README.md` in the repository root.
*   `template_path` (Optional): Path to a custom Markdown template file to be used by the AI.
*   `exclude_files` (Optional): A comma-separated string of file/folder patterns to exclude from being considered by the AI for context (e.g., `tests/,docs/`).
