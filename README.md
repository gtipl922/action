## 🚀 Installation and Usage

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Usage

#### 🏃‍♂️ Run in Development Mode

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### 🏗️ Build for Production

To build the application for production to the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### 🧪 Run Tests

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```
Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn test
```
